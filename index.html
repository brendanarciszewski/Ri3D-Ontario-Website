      	<header><h2>Our Values</h2></header>
      	<p>We want to make FRC more competitive in Ontario. Here are what guides us.</p>
      	<h3>Openness</h3>
      	<p>We want everyone to have the chance to participate in Ri3D. As such, all activities undertaken by this team will be publicized. There will be a livestream and active social media engagement throughout Ri3D.</p>
      	<h3>Quality through Innovation</h3>
      	<p>Our main objective is to inspire other teams to build better robots. As such, we will rigorously design and prototype to develop the best robot possible in 72 hours.</p>
      	<h3>Safety</h3>
      	<p>To ensure that everyone has fun at Ri3D, we need to keep safety as a top priority. As such, we will follow all rules and regulations of the building. We will require that you show us your ability to use machining tools, and only once this has been shown will you be allowed to use equipment. There may be forms you will have to sign. We may ask you to provide character references.</p>

      	<h3>Where is Ri3D Ontario building?</h3>
      	<p>While a build space has yet to be confirmed, the talks are promising.</p>
      	<h3>Will there be accomodations provided?</h3>
      	<p>We're not sleeping. Are you? Seriously, one of our criteria of the location that we pick is that there will be somewhere to sleep.</p>

      	<p>This is something we will confirm after we confirm the location.</p>
      	<h3>When will I find out if I made the team?</h3>
      	<p>We hope to confirm placement on the team by December 20.</p>
      	<h3>I have something that I don't need anymore.</h3>
